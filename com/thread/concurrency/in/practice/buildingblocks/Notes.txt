Synchronized collection:
-----------------------
Collections.synchronizedXXX factory methods.

If Vector is synchronized why we need synchronized functin ?
Answer : For compound operation. 
         e.g repeatedly fetch the items until collections are empty.
             and getting the last element.  Will go wrong..
             
             Solution is : external client locking 
             e.g synchronized(list) for iterating 
                 synchronized(list) for deleting.
                 but it will impact the performance because one thread at a time.
                 
Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<String>):
-> Simply puts a lock on every method , so an led to performance degradation.

Concurrent Collections:
-----------------------
->read operation is allowed for all thread
->write operation allowed to few threads.

ConcurrentHashMap -> instead of synchronized map.
CopyOnWriteArrayList -> synchronized list
BlockingQueue ->
ConcurrentLinkedQueue ->
PriorityQueue ->
ConcurrentSkipListMap -> synchronized SortedMap/TreeMap
ConcurrentSkipListSet -> synchronized SortedSet
